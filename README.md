# A2J: Anchor-to-Joint Regression Network for 3D Articulated Pose Estimation from a Single Depth Image
## Introduction
This is the official implementation for the paper, **"A2J: Anchor-to-Joint Regression Network for 3D Articulated Pose Estimation from a Single Depth Image"**, ICCV 2019. 

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective approach termed A2J, for 3D hand and human pose estimation from a single depth image. Wide-range evaluation on 5 datasets demonstrate A2J's superiority.

Please refer to our paper for more details, https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09999.
